A selenium script that orders me a new bus pass from Madison's
transit website.

* Building

  Install the required dependencies.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
  #+END_SRC

  Then move ~busbot~ somewhere executable.  Currently, it expects to
  be in the same directory as ~secrets.yml~.

* Configuring

  Place all your info in ~secrets.yml~.  Be sure to quote numbers
  (like the card number and year) to ensure the trailing zeros are kept.
